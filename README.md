# Giph Me My Fave

This was a personal project that I made to make it easy for people to find and save their favorite giphys without having to login or make an account. It makes use of local storage so that each person can save their own, reload the page, and have it still be there.

The original page loads with trending giphys and then updates the API call as you search for different giphys.

## Viewing The Live App

You can view the live app at https://giph-me-my-fave.herokuapp.com/

## Technologies Used

This app makes use of React, Axios for async API calls, Font Awesome for emoticons, Bootstrap CSS v5.0 for side scrolling favorites, and React's useState to update the state.

This was coded in VSCode and NPM was used for commiting.

## API

This app makes use of Giphy's beta API. Giphy's API was intended to be used on the front-end and doesn't need to be concealed server-side.
